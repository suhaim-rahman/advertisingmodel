# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project builds a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) dataset from Kaggle.

## Project Overview

This project aims to:
1. Preprocess and normalize transaction data
2. Handle class imbalance issues
3. Train classification algorithms (Logistic Regression and Random Forest)
4. Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score

## Code Structure

The main script `credit_card_fraud_detection.py` performs the following steps:
1. Data loading and initial exploration
2. Data preprocessing and normalization
3. Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
4. Model training (Logistic Regression and Random Forest)
5. Model evaluation
6. Feature importance analysis

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

## Usage

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.
2. Run the script:
